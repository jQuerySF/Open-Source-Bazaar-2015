#jQuerySF 2015: Open Source Bazaar

Rather than selling booths to the highest bidder we are going to be offering free booth's and signage to free and open source projects from across the web.

We invite you to apply to take part in this unique opportunity. It will be a fantastic way to reach out to your community, as well as get direct feedback!

More details about the application process to come soon.  In the mean time feel free to start an issue to discuss ideas.
